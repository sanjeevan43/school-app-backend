===========================================
 FIXED ALL IMPORT ERRORS! 
===========================================

The problem was that after refactoring, the code was still using old import paths.

I fixed 5 files:
✅ app/core/database.py
✅ app/core/auth.py  
✅ app/core/encryption.py
✅ app/services/bus_tracking.py
✅ app/services/cascade_updates.py

All changes have been pushed to GitHub.

===========================================
 NOW RUN THESE COMMANDS ON YOUR SERVER:
===========================================

cd /var/www/projects/client_side/selvegam_school

git pull origin main

sudo systemctl restart school-api

sudo systemctl status school-api


After running, check:
https://api.selvagam.com/docs

It should work now! ✅
